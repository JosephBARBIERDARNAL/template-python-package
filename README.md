# Python package template

This template contains :

- a `.gitignore` with all the basic stuff we don't want to track
- 2 github actions: one to format the code with `ruff` and one to run the tests with `pytest`
- a `pyproject.toml` with all the basic elements
- a `setup.py` with all the basic elements
- a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` which checks the formatting of the code
- a licence file (MIT)
